## Plot
 
The film begins in 2020, when NASA launches the first manned mission to Mars, led by Commander Luke Graham (Don Cheadle). The crew lands on the planet and discovers an ancient structure that resembles a human face. They send a video transmission to Earth, but soon after, they are hit by a massive sandstorm that destroys their equipment and kills most of them.
 
Back on Earth, NASA organizes a rescue mission, consisting of Commander Woody Blake (Tim Robbins), his wife and pilot Terri Fisher (Connie Nielsen), co-pilot Jim McConnell (Gary Sinise), and scientist Phil Ohlmyer (Jerry O'Connell). They depart on the Mars Recovery Vehicle (MRV), a spacecraft that can land and take off from Mars.
 
On their way to Mars, they encounter a micrometeoroid storm that damages their MRV and forces them to use their landing module as a lifeboat. Woody sacrifices himself to save Terri when his tether breaks during a spacewalk. The remaining crew members land on Mars and find Luke alive in the face structure. He reveals that the structure is actually a portal to another dimension, where an alien intelligence awaits them.
